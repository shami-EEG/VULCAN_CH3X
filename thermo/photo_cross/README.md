This folder contains photochemical cross sections.
Most of the cross sections are from Leiden Observatory database (http://home.strw.leidenuniv.nl/~ewine/photo), except for:
CO, OH, NO3, HNO3, HNO2, N2O and NO2 are from PhiDrates.txt
(where NO2 combines NO/O1D and NO/O to obtain the total absorption cross section.)
N2H4 is from MPI-Mainz UV/VIS Spectral Atlas (http://satellite.mpic.de/spectral_atlas/index.html)
